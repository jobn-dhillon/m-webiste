 <font   size="4"<br><br> A database is a collection of logically relate information , which is available for one or more users in a way, so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.It is actually a place , ehere related piece of information is stored and various operations can be performed on it by the user.</br></br>

 <h2> <font size="5" color = "green">Need for a Database </br></h2></font> The need for a database arose in the early 1960's in response to the traditional file processing system. In the file processing system , the data is stored in the form of files and a number of application programmes are written by programmmers to add, modify and delete or to retrieve data to and from apppropriate files.</br> However, the file processing system has a number of problems, which are as follows:
</br> <b> -> </b> Some information may be duplicate in several files.</br> <b> -> </b> The file processing system lacks the insulation between progra and data. </br> <b> -> </b> Handling  new queries is different , since it requeries change in the existing application programs or requirs a new application program.</br></bR>

<b><font size="5" color="green"> Components of a Database </b> </br> </font>A database consists of several componenets. Each component plays an important role in the database system environment. </br> The major components of database are as follows : </br></br> <b> DATA </B></BR> It is raw numbers,characters or facts represented by values. Most of the organisations generate, store and process large amount of data. The data acts as a bridge between hardware and software. </br> <b> SOFTWARE </b></br> It is a set of programs lies between the stored data and the users of database. It is used to managed the overall computerised database. </br> <b> HARDWARE </B></BR> It is the physical aspect of a computer , telecommunication and database, which consists of the secondary storage devices such as magnetic discs etc, on which data is stored.</br> <b> USERS </B></br>It is the person who needs information from a database to caarry out its primary bussiness responsibilities. 


</br></br> <b><font size="5" color=" green"> Features of a databse </b></br></font> Features of database are as follows : </br> <b> Tables </b></br>It is the building block of any relational database model. A database consists of many tables.</br> </br> <b> Queries </b></br> It is an inquiry into the database using the SELECT command.These statements give you filtered data according to your conditions. </br></br> <b> Forms </b> </br> In a database, a form is a window or a screen that contains numerous fields or spaces to enter data. forms can be used to view an interface in user specified layout. </br></br><b> Layout </b></br> When you want to print those records which are fetched from your database , design a report. It is an effective way to present data in a printed format. 

</br></br> <font size="5" color="red"> DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM </FONT></br> It is the collection of programs that enables users to create , maintain database and control all the access to the database . It is the computer based record keeping system. </br> The primary goal of the DBMS is to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information. It acts as an interface between the application program and the data stored in the database. </br> DBMS is a software package that manages database . e.g. MySQL, INGRES, MS-Access. </br> A short list of database applications would include : </br> <b> -> </b> Inventory   
</br> <b> -> </b> Payroll </br> <b> -> </b> Orders </br> <b> -> </b> Reservation </br>
